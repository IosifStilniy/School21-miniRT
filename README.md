### INTRODUCTION

When it comes to rendering 3-dimensional computer-generated images there are 2 possible approaches: “*Rasterization*”, which is used by almost all graphic engines because
of its efficiency and “*Ray Tracing*”.
The “*Ray Tracing*” method, developed for the first time in 1968 (but improved upon
since) is even today more expensive in computation than the “*Rasterization*” method.
As a result, it is not yet fully adapted to real time use-cases but it produce a much higher
degree of visual realism.

Before you can even begin to produce such high-quality graphics, you must master the basics: the ***miniRT*** is your first ray tracer coded in C, normed and humble but
functional.
The main goal of ***miniRT*** is to prove to yourself that you can implement any mathematics or physics formulas without being a mathematician, we will only implement the
most basics ray tracing features here so just keep calm, take a deep breath and don’t
panic! After this project you’ll be able to show off nice-looking pictures to justify the
number of hours you’re spending at school...
